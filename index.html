                If you are comfortable with graphing and have perhaps dabbled in a bit of Calculus I, then feel free to continue on to 
                the rest of the site.  But if it has been some time since you were forced to learn this stuff, below is a brief overview 
                of mathematical functions and how they are graphed.

            <h2 class="heading"><span id="graphing101"></span>Graphing 101</h2>
            <p>A <em>graph</em> is a drawing that illustrates an algebraic operation or equation in a two-dimensional plane.  A graph allows
                you to see the characteristics of an algebraic statement immediately.
            </p>
            <p>To graph an algebraic equation, we use a <em>coordinate plane</em> that features two intersecting <em>axes</em> - two 
                perpendicular lines that cross at a point called the <em>origin</em>.  The horizontal line is called the X-axis, and the 
                vertical line is called the Y-axis.  The scales on the axes are shown with little tick marks.  Any given point on the 
                graph is identified by an ordered pair of <em>coordinates</em>.  The <em>x</em>-coordinate indicates how far and in which direction
                the point is from the origin along the X-axis, and the <em>y</em>-coordinate indicates how far from the origin and in
                which direction the point is along the Y-axis.  Coordinates that lie to the right and above the origin are positive, while
                those to the left and below the origin are negative.  A line on a graph is a collection of many points, each one identified
                by a value for <em>x</em> and a value for <em>y</em>.
            </p>
            <h2 class="heading"><span id="functions"></span>Functions</h2>
            <p>Not to be confused with software functions, a mathematical function is a relationship between two variables that
                features exactly one output value for every input value - in other words, exactly one <em>y</em>-value for every 
                <em>x</em>-value inserted into the function equation.  At every <em>x</em>-value on the graph, the function calculates
                one <em>y</em>-value, drawing a line that moves across the graph as the <em>x</em>-values move from negative to
                positive (left to right).  
            </p>
            
            <h2 class="heading"><span id="functionNotation"></span>Function Notation</h2>
            <p>
                The "<em>f (x)</em>" that is found on the left side of the equals sign, pronounced "F of X", tells us that we  
                should replace the <em>x</em> in the equation on the right side of the equals sign with some value, and then calculate 
                the equation with that value.  The result is the <em>y</em>-value at that <em>x</em>-value on the graph. To indicate an exponent, we use the <em>carrot</em> symbol (shift + 6).
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, suppose we have a function such as <em>f (x) = x^2</em>.  If we replace the <em>x</em> in the equation 
                with a value of three, we can rewrite the function like so: <em> f (3) = 3^2</em>.  So when <em>x</em> is three, <em>y</em> is nine.  With every value of <em>x</em> on the graph, the function calculates a value for <em>y</em>.
            </p>
            <h2 class="heading"><span id="slope"></span>Slope</h2>
            <p>
                The <em>slope</em> is a number that represents the steepness and direction of a line.  The greater the numerical value 
                of the slope, the steeper the line is.  If a line's slope is positive, the line rises from left to right.  If the 
                slope is negative, the line falls from left to right.
            </p>
            <h2 class="heading"><span id="derivative"></span>Derivative</h2>
            <p>
                The <em>derivative</em> is an independent function that measures the slope of another function.  If the first function 
                is written as <em>f (x) = ...</em>, its derivative is written as <em>f ' = ...</em> (pronounced "F prime").  
                 Suppose we have a function whose shape on the graph is a parabola (U-shape).  Initially, the slope 
                is negative as the line falls from left to right.  As the line begins to turn, the slope gets closer to zero.  
                When the line is exactly flat, the slope is precisely zero, and when the line begins to turn upwards, the slope 
                turns positive.  
            </p>
            <p>
                When the derivative is graphed, the <em>y</em>-value represents the slope of the first graph at each value for <em>x</em>.  
                When the <em>y</em>-value of the derivative graph is negative (<em>below</em> the X-axis), it means the slope of the first function is negative 
                at that <em>x</em>-value on its graph.  When the <em>y</em>-value is positive (<em>above</em> the X-axis), it means the slope of 
                the first function is positive at that <em>x</em>-value.  And when the <em>y</em>-value is exactly
                zero, it means the line on the first graph is flat at that <em>x</em>-value.  Also, a greater 
                absolute-value of <em>y</em> (moving away from the origin) represents a steeper slope.  Therefore, the shape of the derivative graph can measure the rate at which the 
                slope of the first function is changing.
